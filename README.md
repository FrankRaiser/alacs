# Alacs - Static analysis for Scala #
## Goals ##
The aim is to provide a tool for finding defects in Scala tools by analyzing ASTs in compilation. Think [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/) for Scala.

## Resources 
The [scala-corpus](https://github.com/alacscala/scala-corpus) is a large collection of Scala code intended for testing Alacs.

## Contributing ##
There are two ways to contribute to Alacs:
* Writing code (e.g., submitting patches, joining the team, etc.)
* Submitting suggestions for bug reports. You can do this on [the wiki](https://github.com/alacscala/alacs/wiki).
Thank you for helping improve Alacs!
