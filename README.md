# Alacs - Static analysis for Scala #
## Welcome! ##
Work is beginning as of December, 2010.

## Goals ##
The aim is to provide a tool for finding defects in Scala tools by analyzing bytecode. It may use FindBugs internally.

## Resources 
The [scala-corpus](https://github.com/alacscala/scala-corpus) is a large collection of Scala code intended for testing Alacs.

## Contributing ##
Please join! Check out some [background material](https://github.com/alacscala/alacs/blob/master/dev/resources.md) on static aalysis and the JVM.
